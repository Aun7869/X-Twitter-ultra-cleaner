# X-Twitter-ultra-cleaner
A professional tool for X (Twitter) to bulk unlike, delete tweets, and manage follows with smart auto-stop and bubble mode
Project Name: X (Twitter) Ultra Cleaner Pro

🚀 Key Features
Bulk Unlike: Automatically unlikes tweets while scrolling through your "Likes" tab.

Bulk Delete: Scans your profile and automates the deletion process (Caret > Delete > Confirm).

Filtered Unfollow: * Unfollow Everyone: Standard bulk unfollow.

Unfollow Unverified: Skips profiles with the verified badge (useful for keeping professional connections).

Unfollow Non-Followers: Automatically skips anyone who follows you back.

Bubble Mode: Minimize the UI into a sleek draggable 𝕏 bubble to keep it out of the way while it works.

Smart Auto-Stop: Set a target number of actions (e.g., 50, 100), and the script will stop automatically when reached.

Speed Control: * Preset Mode: 3 scientifically tested speeds (Safest, Safe, Risky) to balance speed and account safety.

Custom Mode: Define your own millisecond delays.

Dynamic Themes: Choose between Light, Dark, and AMOLED modes to match your browser theme.

🛠️ Installation
Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey.

Create a new script and paste the code.

Refresh x.com and look for the control panel on the right.

⚠️ Safety Information (Important)
Account Limits: Twitter has rate limits. Using "Fast" mode for too long may lead to a temporary action block.

Randomized Delay: The script uses randomized timing (Human-Mimicry) to avoid bot detection.

Best Practice: It is recommended to use Normal (Safe) mode for daily cleaning and Slow (Safest) for large accounts.

💡 Helpful Tips for Users
Scroll Trigger: The script works on the items currently visible on your screen. If it doesn't find a button, it will automatically scroll down to load more content.

Mobile Support: Fully draggable and responsive—works great on mobile browsers that support Tampermonkey (like Mises or Quetta).
