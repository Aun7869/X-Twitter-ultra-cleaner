# X-Twitter-ultra-cleaner
A professional tool for X (Twitter) to bulk unlike, delete tweets, and manage follows with smart auto-stop and bubble mode

Project Name: X (Twitter) Ultra Cleaner Pro

📖 How to Use
To begin cleaning, you must manually navigate to the correct section of your profile. The script will handle the rest.

1. 🗑️ Bulk Delete & Undo Reposts
Where to go: Navigate to your Profile page (x.com/yourname).

What it does: It will look for your own Posts to delete and your Reposts to undo.

Pro Tip: If you want to delete Replies, stay on the "Posts" tab but scroll down slightly so the script focuses on the timeline.

2. ❤️ Bulk Unlike
Where to go: Navigate to your Likes tab (x.com/yourname/likes).

What it does: It identifies the heart icon and unlikes posts sequentially.

Note: If your Likes are private, ensure you are logged into your own account.

3. 👤 Filtered Unfollow
Where to go: Navigate to your Following list (x.com/yourname/following).

What it does: * Select Everyone to clear your list.

Select Unverified to keep people with Blue Checks.

Select Non-Followers to only remove people who don't follow you back.

🛠️ Operating the Control Panel
Select a Speed: * Slow (Safest): Best for cleaning thousands of items over a long period.

Normal (Safe): The recommended balance for most users.

Fast (Risky): Use only for small batches (less than 100).

Set Auto-Stop: Enter a number (e.g., 50) to ensure the script stops after it reaches that limit. This is highly recommended to stay under X’s rate limits.

Minimize: Click the "−" button to turn the UI into a floating bubble. You can drag this bubble anywhere on the screen while the script runs in the background.

Start/Stop: Click START to begin. You will see the "Processed" counter increase in real-time.

💡 Troubleshooting for Users
Script stopped scrolling? X sometimes pauses the feed. Simply scroll manually once or refresh the page and press Start again.

UI is off-screen? Drag the bubble/UI to the center. The "Smart Position" logic will fix the alignment when you maximize it.

Buttons not clicking? Ensure your browser tab is active. Most browsers "sleep" scripts if the tab is hidden for too long.

⚠️ Safety Information (Important)
Account Limits: Twitter has rate limits. Using "Fast" mode for too long may lead to a temporary action block.

Randomized Delay: The script uses randomized timing (Human-Mimicry) to avoid bot detection.

Best Practice: It is recommended to use Normal (Safe) mode for daily cleaning and Slow (Safest) for large accounts.

💡 Helpful Tips for Users
Scroll Trigger: The script works on the items currently visible on your screen. If it doesn't find a button, it will automatically scroll down to load more content.

Mobile Support: Fully draggable and responsive—works great on mobile browsers that support Tampermonkey (like Mises or Quetta).
